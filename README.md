# Origins

This repository contains almost all the first programs that I've ever written, dating back to the year spanning 1999-2002.

## A bit of history

When I was in mid school, about the age of 14, my father took home a very old laptop (I later discovered it was an IBM 186) and I started playing with DOS. Only by chance I've found that the things I was seeing when running a program called GWBASIC was very similar to the last chapter in math book which I started to read very interested. This is how I got introduced to programmig.

## Content

This repository contains programs I've written first in GWBASIC on DOS 6.2 and then on QBASIC on DOS 8.0. Interpreters are included.

Among the programs there are some (GWBASIC) to play Bingo, calculate school probabilities, build a ASCII character map. Some others (QBASIC) include a graphical Agenda, a program to chat and play between computer using a serial link, a program to simulate orbit around earth and more.

All programs use Italian as text and comments language.

## Run

Although it's long time I don't run these programs they should work straight away on any Windows machine on the DOS interpreter. Just open the BASIC interpreter of choice and inside it open the code and run. I'm not sure if it's possible under Linux and how.
